📊 FinTrack: Automated Financial Reporting Tool

FinTrack is a Python-based utility designed to streamline business finance management by automating data extraction, processing, and report generation.

It connects to a PostgreSQL database (simulated via Railway) to fetch raw transaction data, processes it using Pandas for robust cleaning and summarization, and produces two essential outputs:
