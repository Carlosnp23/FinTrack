# FinTrack: Automated Financial Reporting Tool

** FinTrack is a Python-based utility designed to streamline business finance management by automating data extraction, analysis, and report generation.

It connects to a PostgreSQL database (simulated via Railway) to retrieve raw transaction data, processes this data using Pandas for robust cleaning and summarization, and generates two critical outputs:

1. ** Comprehensive Excel Report (.xlsx): Provides raw transaction details and a clean, formatted monthly summary table with thousand separators.

2. ** Professional PDF Report (.pdf): Includes high-quality, professional visualizations generated by Matplotlib (Monthly Income vs. Expense charts and Category breakdowns) alongside the detailed monthly summary table, ensuring easy sharing and consumption of financial insights.

Key Technologies: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, ReportLab, PostgreSQL (via DBAPI).
